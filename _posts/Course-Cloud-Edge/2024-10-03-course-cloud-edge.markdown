## 1. Introduction to Related Concepts
Cloud and Edge Computing are based on distributed computing models, where multiple remote components work together to achieve a common goal. Edge Computing brings services closer to end users, while Cloud Computing enables access to shared resources at scale.

## 2. Virtualization
Virtualization is a key technology in Cloud Computing. It allows multiple operating systems to be run on a single physical host by sharing the underlying hardware resources. This isolation of environments is achieved through hypervisors, which are classified into two types:

- Type 1 hypervisor (bare-metal), which runs directly on the hardware.
- Type 2 hypervisor (hosted), which runs on top of a host operating system.
Containers are another form of virtualization, where processes are isolated but share the same operating system kernel, reducing overhead compared to traditional virtual machines.

## 3. Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing allows on-demand access to a set of configurable resources (networks, servers, storage, etc.). Its main characteristics include:

Scalability: Resources can be dynamically adjusted according to demand.
Pay-as-you-go model: Users pay only for what they consume.
Remote services: The Cloud is accessible via the Internet, eliminating the need for complex local infrastructure.
The main service models are:

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provision of computing infrastructure.
- PaaS (Platform as a Service): Provision of platforms for application development.
- SaaS (Software as a Service): Provision of software directly accessible via the Internet.

## 4. Edge Computing
Edge Computing brings computing closer to users and data sources, particularly for IoT (Internet of Things) systems. It allows data to be processed locally, thus reducing latency, particularly for critical applications such as Industry 4.0 or autonomous vehicle management. Edge Computing often works in addition to the Cloud for real-time processing needs.

## 5. Cloud Federation and Cooperation
Cloud federation allows the interconnection of multiple Cloud environments to manage dynamic workloads and provide increased resilience. This model is particularly used to distribute services and manage load peaks between different Cloud providers, thus ensuring continuous availability.

## 6. Fog Computing
Fog Computing extends the principles of Edge Computing by integrating cloud and compute capabilities closer to end users. This architecture reduces the amount of data sent to the centralized cloud, enabling real-time processing with minimal latency, while maintaining interoperability with IoT systems.

## 7. Conclusion
The course explores modern distributed computing architectures that combine cloud and edge computing to meet growing data processing requirements. Integrating cloud systems with virtualization, automation, and resource management technologies provides powerful and scalable solutions for businesses and users. The future of these technologies lies in their ability to adapt to the needs of critical applications in real time, while ensuring data security and efficiency.
